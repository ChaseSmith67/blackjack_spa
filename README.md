# Blackjack Trainer by Chase Smith

## About

This application is a simple web app intended to teach the
user basic blackjack strategy. It was built for a Software
Engineering course as my final project for the term.

## Installation

To install and run the application, you need to have Node 
installed on your system. Clone the repository and run 
npm install in the terminal to download and install all the
necessary dependencies. Once the dependencies are intstalled,
type node App.js to run the program. The application has a 
Tutorial Page that explains how to play the game.

## Known Issues and Limitations
The game was designed to have a statistics tracking system
that allows the player to track their progress. It was 
implemented as a separate microservice, which is not yet 
integrated into this release completely. The game also does
not currently include the ability for the player to split
their hand, though that is something I would like to add when
I find the time.
